# GitHub Secrets Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get your SSH private key
Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and run:
```
cat ~/.ssh/hetzner_key
```

Copy the ENTIRE output (including -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----)

## Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets
1. Go to: https://github.com/yourHostJost/SorcerySW6/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"

### Secret 1:
- Name: HETZNER_SERVER_IP
- Value: 91.99.27.91

### Secret 2:
- Name: HETZNER_SSH_KEY
- Value: [Paste the entire SSH private key from Step 1]

## Step 3: Verify secrets are added
You should see both secrets listed in your repository secrets page.

## What this enables:
- Automatic deployment to your Hetzner server when you push to the 'staging' branch
- Secure SSH connection from GitHub Actions to your server
- Automated Shopware 6 updates on your staging environment
